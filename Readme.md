# Mindfulness and Meditation Gamification

## Project Description

**Mindfulness and Meditation Gamification** is a blockchain-based project designed to incentivize mindfulness and meditation practices. The platform allows users to track their meditation sessions, earn rewards in the form of ERC20 tokens, and unlock badges for reaching specific milestones. The smart contract ensures transparency and fairness by recording every action on the blockchain, allowing users to see their progress and claim their rewards directly from the contract.

By combining mindfulness with gamification, this project helps users maintain a consistent meditation routine while earning tangible rewards, fostering a healthier lifestyle and personal growth.

## Contract Address

0xd9145CCE52D386f254917e481eB44e9943F39138

## Key Features

- **User Meditation Tracking**: Tracks the number of meditation sessions completed by each user. The data is stored on the blockchain for transparency and security.
  
- **Token Rewards**: Users earn ERC20 tokens for completing meditation sessions. Each completed session earns 1 token. Tokens can be claimed once they accumulate enough balance.

- **Badge System**: Users earn badges when they reach specific milestones. For example:
  - "Mindful Beginner" at 10 meditation sessions.
  - "Zen Master" at 50 meditation sessions.

- **Decentralized and Transparent**: The entire system operates on the Ethereum blockchain (or other compatible networks), ensuring transparency in reward distribution, progress tracking, and badge achievements.

- **Reward Claiming**: Users can claim their earned rewards (ERC20 tokens) using the `claimRewards()` function. The system ensures users can only claim what they have earned.

- **Owner Withdrawal**: The contract owner can withdraw tokens from the contract if necessary (e.g., for replenishing rewards or maintaining the system).

- **Event Logging**: Key actions such as completing a meditation session, earning a badge, and claiming rewards are logged as events on the blockchain, making them transparent and traceable.

## How to Use

1. **Complete Meditation**:
   - Every time you complete a meditation session, call the `completeMeditation()` function.
   - This will increase your meditation count, reward you with tokens, and may unlock new badges.

2. **Claim Rewards**:
   - After completing meditation sessions, you can claim your earned tokens by calling the `claimRewards()` function. Once you reach a sufficient token balance, you can withdraw them.

3. **Earn Badges**:
   - As you complete meditation milestones (e.g., 10, 50 sessions), badges will be unlocked, and events will notify you.

4. **Check Your Progress**:
   - Use the `checkRewards()` function to check your accumulated rewards.

## Future Enhancements

- **Referral Program**: A referral system where users can invite others to join the platform and earn extra rewards or tokens.
  
- **Group Challenges**: Add functionality for group meditation challenges where users work together to reach a collective goal and earn rewards as a group.

- **Advanced Badges**: Create more complex badge structures with special titles and rewards for advanced users.

- **Staking Mechanism**: Introduce a staking feature where users can stake their earned tokens to receive additional rewards or bonuses.

- **Integration with Meditation Apps**: Integrate with popular meditation apps (such as Calm, Headspace, etc.) to automatically track meditation sessions and award tokens seamlessly.
